# SnakeGame

For Mac OS X users: In order to run the game in Xcode, the ncurses library must be downloaded through homebrew. 
Also, Xcode must be configured so that the terminal will open when the code is executed. (Unfortunate steps that must
be taken for Macs because Apple didn't include the library and Xcode itself doesn't have a terminal)
